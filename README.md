# Flashcard

Flashcard is a simple web app I created to help with studying by using digital flashcards.

## How to use

- Click a card to flip between the question and the answer.
- Tap "back" or "next" to switch between cards.
- Want to add your own question or answer? Just edit the HTML and change the contentâ€”it's easy!
- (Planned) In the future, I'll add a feature to change questions and answers dynamically.
